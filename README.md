## My process

1.- Checked the mock-up for the final objective
2.- checkede all the assets and styles to be used
3.- Created semantic html structure according to what the project needed
4.- Gave basic styles
5.- Gave the rest of the styles
6.- Gave personal details according to what the design system needed
7.- Added media queries
8.- Made it fully responsive

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Needed to update some knowledge about the absolute position to help 
improve compatibility with some resolutions.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.attribution{
    position: absolute;
    margin-top: 650px;
    margin-left: 10px;
    bottom: 5px;
}
}
```

### Continued development

I need to focus on improving the pure css understanding.
